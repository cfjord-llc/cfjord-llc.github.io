                    <p>I love AI. I've built my career helping organizations understand, integrate, and thrive alongside it. But one thing I've learned is that more AI doesn't always mean better results. In fact, too much AI—applied without thought—can become a problem of its own.</p>
                    
                    <p>Let's be honest: AI is the shiny new tool in every boardroom and brainstorm. It promises efficiency, insight, and scale. It writes, predicts, personalizes, and even manages. But like any powerful tool, it needs to be used with care. AI is like salt in a recipe: a little enhances everything, but too much will ruin the dish.</p>

                            <p>The question we should be asking isn't "How much AI <em>can</em> we use?" but rather, "How much AI <em>should</em> we use?"</p>

                    <h2>When AI Becomes Too Much</h2>
                    <p>At its core, the problem is simple: AI can overwhelm people.</p>
                    
                    <p>We've seen it in research and practice. When AI performs too strongly or assumes too much responsibility, human performance often suffers. People defer to the system even when it's wrong. They disengage. They start to lose touch with the very processes they're meant to lead. In safety-critical domains like aviation and healthcare, this isn't just a philosophical problem—it's a dangerous one.</p>
                    
                    <p>The issue isn't that AI is unhelpful. It's that over-automation stifles human contribution. Humans lose not only control, but the opportunity to learn, reflect, and improve. And when humans are sidelined, the system as a whole becomes more brittle.</p>
                    
                    <p>AI should enhance human capabilities, not eclipse them.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section id="agentic-ai" class="blog-section">
                    <h2>Enter Agentic AI: A New Kind of Teammate</h2>
                    <p>Until recently, AI was mostly reactive. It answered questions, responded to prompts, or carried out limited tasks within a narrow scope. But we're now entering the age of <strong>agentic AI</strong>—systems that act with autonomy, pursue goals, and take initiative. These systems won't just assist; they'll collaborate.</p>
                    
                    <p>And that changes everything.</p>
                    
                    <p>Once AI agents start acting like team members, they affect the team itself. They make decisions. They communicate. They generate options. They even escalate issues. In short, they start behaving like coworkers.</p>
                    
                    <p>This means our teams are no longer just human teams using AI tools—they are <em>hybrid teams</em>, where AI is an active participant.</p>

                <section id="crowded-teams" class="blog-section">
                    <h2>Teams Are Getting Crowded</h2>
                    <p>Imagine a project team of five humans and one AI assistant. Now imagine that project a year later—with four AI agents and three humans. Who's in charge? Who's leading? Who's learning?</p>
                    
                    <p>Research shows that when the number of AI teammates begins to outnumber human teammates, team performance and morale drop. Not just because the AI is flawed, but because team dynamics become unmanageable. Humans feel outnumbered, unheard, and disoriented. Communication suffers. Trust erodes.</p>
                    
                    <p>This isn't science fiction—it's already happening in organizations that over-automate internal processes or adopt swarms of bots to handle customer service, operations, and planning. As the AI footprint grows, the human experience shrinks.</p>
                    
                    <p>And it's not just about feelings—it's about outcomes. Teams need coordination, shared awareness, and psychological safety. Those don't scale well when half the team doesn't sleep, doesn't explain itself, and doesn't feel human.</p>

                <section id="human-core" class="blog-section">
                    <h2>Preserving the Human Core</h2>
                    <p>Here's the good news: we still have a choice.</p>
                    
                    <p>We can choose to design systems where humans remain at the center—where AI is the support, not the spotlight. Where technology uplifts rather than replaces. Where team dynamics are carefully managed to ensure humans still lead, connect, and contribute meaningfully.</p>
                    
                    <p>We need to remember: AI doesn't succeed in a vacuum. It succeeds because of humans—because we frame the questions, spot the exceptions, and decide what matters.</p>
                    
                    <p>Keeping that human core intact isn't just ethical. It's strategic.</p>

                <section id="scaling" class="blog-section">
                    <h2>Scaling AI Without Losing People</h2>
                    <p>Organizations are understandably eager to scale AI. It saves time, reduces costs, and offers shiny new dashboards. But scaling AI without scaling thoughtfulness is risky.</p>
                    
                    <p>Too much AI leads to disconnection—between people and their work, between teammates, and between users and outcomes. It also leads to fragility: when everything depends on automation, the system loses resilience.</p>
                    
                    <p>Balance is the answer.</p>
                    
                    <p>Yes, use AI. Absolutely, bring in automation where it adds value. But don't lose sight of the human process. And don't allow AI proliferation to become people suppression.</p>

                    <h2>The Future Is Human-Led</h2>
                    <p>The truth is, we don't need fewer AI systems—we need better balance. We need AI that complements human expertise, not crowds it out. We need teams where AI is a partner, not a replacement.</p>
                    
                    <p>The future of work isn't human <em>or</em> AI—it's human <em>with</em> AI.</p>
                    
                    <p>But if we let the scales tip too far, we risk building a future where humans are just another cog in an AI machine. And that's not the future I want to help create.</p>
                    
                    <p>Let's build AI ecosystems that empower people, preserve human roles, and prioritize thoughtful integration. Let's make sure AI doesn't just show up in the room—but shows up as a respectful, useful, and balanced teammate.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Because when we get the mix right, everyone—human and machine—wins.</strong></p>
