                                <p>My journey currently has me in academia, serving as an assistant professor where I specialized in critical areas like human-AI interaction, AI technology design, AI acceptance, and broader technology integration. This academic foundation allowed me to dive deep into the theoretical underpinnings and emerging trends of AI, but it was the opportunity to apply these concepts across a vast array of real-world scenarios that truly shaped my perspective.</p>

                                <h2>Real-World Experience</h2>
                                <p>I've been fortunate to explore these ideas firsthand in contexts as varied as manufacturing to software development, emergency response, education, agriculture, and much more. These experiences consistently revealed a common thread: the gap between groundbreaking technology and an organization's ability to seamlessly adopt and leverage it has only grown with the introduction of AI.</p>
                                <p>Through partnerships with industry leaders and government agencies, I've had the opportunity to translate research findings into practical solutions that address real organizational challenges. This blend of academic rigor and practical application has been instrumental in developing frameworks that truly work in the field.</p>

                                <p>My passion is to see the direct impacts of these solutions—how they empower workforces, optimize processes, and unlock new possibilities. C Fjord exists to be that hands-on partner, guiding organizations through technological transitions with a human-centered approach.</p>
                                <p>I believe that successful AI integration isn't just about technology implementation—it's about aligning these powerful tools with human needs, organizational cultures, and strategic objectives. By bridging this divide, we can create technology implementations that people actually want to use and that deliver measurable value.</p>

                                <p>At C Fjord, we take a fundamentally different approach to AI consulting. Instead of starting with technology and forcing organizational adaptation, we begin with a deep understanding of your people, processes, and objectives. This human-centered methodology ensures that the technological solutions we implement are not only cutting-edge but also contextually appropriate and sustainably valuable.</p>
                                <p>Through tailored training programs, strategic consulting, and hands-on implementation support, we help organizations navigate the complexities of AI adoption while maintaining focus on what truly matters: empowering your people to achieve extraordinary results.</p>
