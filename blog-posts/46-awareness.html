                <section id="introduction" class="blog-section">
                    <p>Awareness has always been a foundational principle of good teamwork. When humans work together effectively, it's not just about shared goals or complementary skills—it's also about knowing what others are doing, anticipating their needs, and adapting your own behavior in response. In traditional teams, this kind of awareness is cultivated organically: a glance across the room, a project update in Slack, a hallway conversation. These micro-moments of context keep teams aligned.</p>
                    
                    <p>But AI throws a wrench into that system.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike human teammates, AI systems don't casually mention what they're up to. They don't sigh when overloaded or shoot you a quick message when a task changes. In fact, many AI systems don't communicate much at all unless explicitly programmed to. This lack of transparency can create real friction in teams that are used to having a steady sense of what everyone is working on.</p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>The most effective teams don't just work together—they maintain a shared understanding of what's happening. With AI, this understanding needs to be deliberately designed.</p>
                        </blockquote>

                    <h2>The Awareness Gap</h2>
                    <p>The challenge with AI isn't just that it doesn't speak up—it's that it often can't. Many modern AI systems operate as black boxes, producing outputs without explaining their inner workings or reasoning. That opacity makes it hard for humans to stay in the loop and know what the AI is doing, why it's doing it, or even when it's changed course.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is a problem for any team trying to function with trust and cohesion. Imagine a team member who silently makes decisions that affect everyone else, without warning or explanation. You wouldn't tolerate that behavior from a person, but we're currently tolerating it from machines. And as these machines become more embedded in workflows, the impact of this lack of awareness will only grow.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section id="transparency" class="blog-section">
                    <h2>Building a Culture of Transparency</h2>
                    <p>The solution starts with culture. Teams that work with AI need to prioritize awareness as a value. That means creating systems, rituals, and expectations that encourage regular updates—not just from humans, but from AI systems as well.</p>
                    
                    <p>Developers can play a huge role here. One of the most important design goals for any AI system in a team setting should be transparency. That could mean:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Logging actions in a team dashboard</li>
                        <li>Explaining decisions in plain language</li>
                        <li>Offering just-in-time prompts about what the system is currently doing</li>
                        <li>Providing confidence levels with outputs</li>
                        <li>Creating visibility into data sources and processing steps</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Think of it as status reporting for machines.</p>
                    
                    <p>Of course, not all awareness needs to be real-time or granular. What matters is the <em>right</em> level of awareness. Just like we don't need to know every keystroke our colleagues make, we don't need to track every computation an AI system runs. But we do need a shared understanding of responsibilities, capabilities, and limitations. We need to know what an AI <em>can</em> do, <em>is</em> doing, and <em>has</em> done—at least enough to coordinate around it.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section id="beyond-tech" class="blog-section">
                    <h2>Staying Aware Beyond the Tech</h2>
                    <p>There's another level to awareness in AI-human teams, and it's often overlooked: awareness of the ecosystem itself.</p>
                    
                    <p>If you're using an AI tool, it's not enough to know what that tool does today. You also need to understand where it's headed. Is the company behind the tool planning major changes? Is a new version being released? Has the model been retrained with new data? These shifts can change how an AI behaves—and by extension, how your team functions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Organizations should empower teams to track these changes. That might mean:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assigning someone to monitor vendor updates</li>
                        <li>Building in review cycles where tools are re-evaluated</li>
                        <li>Creating documentation that traces AI system evolution</li>
                        <li>Establishing regular check-ins on system behavior changes</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Transparency at the organizational level helps teams maintain a healthy awareness of their AI environment.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section id="promote" class="blog-section">
                    <h2>Promote Awareness Everywhere</h2>
                    <p>The responsibility to foster awareness isn't just on developers or users. It's on leadership, too. Leaders must create a culture where questions are encouraged, system behavior is reviewed, and clarity is prioritized.</p>
                    
                    <p>One practical step is to build transparency into onboarding. When a new AI tool is introduced, make sure teams understand how it works, how to interpret its outputs, and how to spot when something might be going wrong. Keep these explanations updated, just like you would training materials for a human employee.</p>
                    
                    <p>Another step is to create space for awareness-building rituals. Weekly "AI standups," shared dashboards, or collaborative "postmortems" that include both human and AI behavior can all help. The goal isn't to micromanage the tech, but to normalize the act of keeping tabs on what everyone—machine or human—is doing.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Practical Awareness-Building Tactics</h3>
                    <ul class="blog-list">
                        <li><strong>Create AI system cards:</strong> One-pagers that explain what each AI system does, its limitations, and how to work with it</li>
                        <li><strong>Implement explainability features:</strong> Ensure AI tools can explain their actions in human-readable terms</li>
                        <li><strong>Build shared dashboards:</strong> Create visual representations of AI activity and decision-making</li>
                        <li><strong>Establish feedback loops:</strong> Create mechanisms for humans to ask questions of AI systems and get meaningful responses</li>
                    </ul>

                <section id="conclusion" class="blog-section conclusion">
                    <h2>Final Thoughts: Awareness Is an Ongoing Practice</h2>
                    <p>Awareness isn't a checkbox. It's a practice. And in a world where AI is a growing part of every team, it's a practice we need to get very good at.</p>
                    
                    <p>As we move into this new era of work, let's ask ourselves: how can we keep the whole team—human and machine—aligned and aware? How do we design tools, processes, and cultures that make visibility the norm rather than the exception?</p>
                    
                    <p>AI may not naturally lend itself to transparency. But that just means we have to be more intentional. Teams thrive when they see the big picture. And it's our job to make sure the picture includes <em>everyone</em>.</p>
